Things that make this really hard / might not make sense: 

1. We code yesno as 2. Does it make sense to have this category? 
Seems really weird to have this as an answer that we are using to predict and trying to predict. 
Would make sense to me to do either 1 of 2 things. Either weight observations (like me and Simon did) or exclude. 
In any case, do we ever want to predict "yesno" and is there enough of these cases for this to make sense?

2. Sub-questions included in the analysis. Is this taken care of somehow or just weird? 

3. Why do we only get one imputation PER missing dataset?
Then we are doing single rather than multiple imputation...
